Static lifetime
Th locals have automatic lifetimes.
Objects with automatic lifetime last as long as containing function.
When a function returns, local variables disappear.
Dynamic objects like the new have dynamic lifetime so these objects last
until they are explicitely deleted.
In c++, delete operation
Dynamic last until explicit allocation
As program executes, the amount of space for dynamic changes
A recursive function will cause automatic objects go down and dynamic
goes up.  Run out of memory happens when these objects collide.

The segment used for dynamic objects is the heap, and the other segment
used for dynamic objects is the stack.

If I say heap you should think dynamic allocation
Stack = functions calling other functions
Compile throws names from the abstract machine.
The things that have names in terms of the abstract machine (only
globals and locals have names)

Allocate ch is the name of the pointer, but the actual dynamic object
doesn't have a name.

For dynamic objects, we have to get at them through local and global
objects.

What is cool about dynamic objects is that you can use it for objects
size unknown.

Every real program accesses dynamic programming all the time, we must
learn to do it correctly!

massive[0x40000] = {0}
name massivo is address

Program uses scrubbed memory, how functions are stored, different
lengths because the shortest number of digits printed for address is 8.
8 hexadecimal digits are not enough.

We have worked exclusively with characters and addresses, let's work
with things that are not characters.  

The computer dutifully switches digits, little Indian order, the content
of pointer we see the bytes in opposite order from left to right

Abstract machine says pair=byte, sizeof returns number of bytes.  What
is the size of a char?

Short = 2 bytes
Long = 8 bytes
Long long = 8 bytes

If we go back to the founding during the 70's, the longest int was 16
bits long.

We've been looking at an awful lot of positive integers, let's look at
negative numbers, which is interesting

Numbers are made out of bytes, 0 - 255, none of the numbers between 0 -
255 are negative

We make a really big positive number -- We look at what happens when we
add numbrs together.  The most important of 1 and -1 = 0

0xff ff ff ff
0x00 00 00 00 01
The hexadecimal digit f is 15.  16 doesn't fit in one hexadecimal digit.

We have an extra digit, but computer doesn't know what to do with it so
we throw it away and get 0.

ffffffffe = 00x00000001

Two's complement representation -- if we have a value in binary, then
the 2's complement version of negative a is defined as flip the bits
separately. 

Flip every bit and then add 1.
We work through this with a shorter number.  Let's say we had 4 bit
numbers, the value of 5 is 0101 in base two, so to take negative 5, we
flip the bits and then add 1, which means we get 1010 + 1, which is 1011

Depending on the type of the object, we can write unsigned and signed
values.
